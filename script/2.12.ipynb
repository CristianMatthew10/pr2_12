The same anteroposterior hip radiograph dataset was used to train two DCNNs (AlexNet and GoogLeNet) to detect NoF fractures. For direct comparison with perceptual training results, deep learning was completed across a variety of dataset sizes (200, 320 and 640 images) with images split into training (80%) and validation (20%). An additional 160 images were used as the final test set. Multiple pre-processing and augmentation techniques were utilised.\\n\\nResults\\nAlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs NoF fracture detection accuracy increased with larger training dataset sizes and mildly with augmentation. Accuracy increased from 81.9% and 88.1% to 89.4% and 94.4% for AlexNet and GoogLeNet respectively. Similarly, the test accuracy for the perceptual training in top-performing medically-naïve individuals increased from 87.6% to 90.5% when trained on 640 images compared with 200 images.\\n\\nConclusions\\nSingle detection tasks in radiology are commonly used in DCNN research with their results often used to make broader claims about machine learning being able to perform as well as subspecialty radiologists. This study suggests that as impressive as recognising fractures is for a DCNN, similar learning can be achieved by top-performing medically-naïve humans with less than 1 hour of perceptual training.'),\n",
       " ('Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations',\n",
       "  'PURPOSE Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non–face-to-face care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday) and outside clinic hours.\\n\\nMETHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from “event logging” records over a 3-year period for both direct patient care and non–face-to-face activities, and were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours.\\n\\nRESULTS Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information regarding clinician time allocation.'),\n",

A custom wearable system extracted 55 metrics for analysis and a K-means algorithm separated patients into functionally distinguished groups based on the derived features. These groups were analyzed to determine which metrics differentiated most and how each cluster improved during early recovery.\\n\\nResults\\nPatients separated into 2 clusters (n = 46 and n = 22) with significantly different test completion times (12.6 s vs 21.6 s, P < .001).

We trained the CNN to analyze wrist radiographs in the dataset. Feasibility of the object detection algorithm was evaluated by intersection of the union (IOU). The diagnostic performance of the network was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index; the results were compared with those of medical professional groups.\\n\\nResults — The object detection model achieved a high average IOU, and none of the IOUs had a value less than 0.5. The AUC of the CNN for this test was 0.96. The network had better performance in distinguishing images with DRFs from normal images compared with a group of radiologists in terms of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index. The network presented a similar diagnostic performance to that of the orthopedists in terms of these variables.\\n\\nInterpretation — The network exhibited a diagnostic ability similar to that of the orthopedists and a performance superior to that of the radiologists in distinguishing AP wrist radiographs with DRFs from normal images under limited conditions.

       "  'In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.'),\n",

The factors determined for prediction of prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions were age, duration of opioid exposure, preoperative hemoglobin, and preoperative medications (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-2-agonists). The elastic-net penalized logistic regression model achieved the best performance across discrimination (c-statistic = 0.77), calibration, and decision curve analysis. This model was incorporated into a digital application able to provide both predictions and explanations (available at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/thaopioid/).\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf externally validated in independent populations, the algorithms developed in this study could improve preoperative screening and support for THA patients at high risk for prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions.

Subjects walked on a walkway equipped with two force plates with piezoelectric 3-component force sensors. Parameters of the vertical, anterior–posterior, and medio-lateral ground reaction forces, such as mean value, push-off time, and slope, were extracted. Then random forest regressors map those parameters via rule induction to the degree of knee osteoarthritis. To boost generalisation ability, a subject-independent protocol is employed. The 5-fold cross-validated accuracy is 72.61% ± 4.24%.

Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning model. The average clinician’s sensitivity was 80.8% (95% CI, 76.7–84.1%) unaided and 91.5% (95% CI, 89.3–92.9%) aided, and specificity was 87.5% (95 CI, 85.3–89.5%) unaided and 93.9% (95% CI, 92.9–94.9%) aided.

Correction factors were developed to adjust data from before the standard pregnancy question was adopted to promote accurate trend analysis. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends for groups of states with similar pregnancy questions.\\n\\nRESULTS: \\nThe estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births) for 48 states and Washington, DC (excluding California and Texas, analyzed separately) increased by 26.6%, from 18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014. California showed a declining trend, whereas Texas had a sudden increase in 2011–2012. Analysis of the measurement change suggests that U.S. rates in the early 2000s were higher than previously reported.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: \\nDespite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal for a 75% reduction in maternal mortality by 2015, the estimated maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington, DC, increased from 2000 to 2014; the international trend was in the opposite direction.

Patient narratives are a potentially valuable but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction and with perioperative outcomes.\\n\\nMethods: \\nAn institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment.\\n\\nResults: \\nMost patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not.\\n\\nConclusions: \\nPatient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, patient-centered care after TSA.'),\n",

When data were not available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used.\\n\\nFindings  In 2016, the US spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on health care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6% (Australia) to 12.4% (Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4% of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1% (range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100\\u202f000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100\\u202f000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8% in the US vs a range of 1% to 3% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was $1443 in the US vs a range of $466 to $939 in other countries.

Videotaped visits were examined for visit length and time devoted to specific topics—a novel approach to study time allocation. A survival analysis model analyzed the effects of patient, physician, and physician practice setting on how clinic time was spent.\\n\\nPrincipal Findings. Very limited amount of time was dedicated to specific topics in office visits. The median visit length was 15.7 minutes covering a median of six topics. About 5 minutes were spent on the longest topic whereas the remaining topics each received 1.1 minutes. While time spent by patient and physician on a topic responded to many factors, length of the visit overall varied little even when contents of visits varied widely. Macro factors associated with each site had more influence on visit and topic length than the nature of the problem patients presented.\\n\\nConclusions. Many topics compete for visit time, resulting in small amount of time being spent on each topic. A highly regimented schedule might interfere with having sufficient time for patients with complex or multiple problems. Efforts to improve the quality of care need to recognize the time pressure on both patients and physicians, the effects of financial incentives, and the time costs of improving patient–physician interactions.\"),\n",

Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient–doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.'),\n",
       " ('Use of Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Identify Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Total Hip Arthroplasty',\n",
       "  'Background: \\nManual chart review is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge possessed by highly trained medical professionals. Natural language processing (NLP) tools are distinctive in their ability to extract critical information from raw text in electronic health records (EHRs). As a proof of concept for the potential application of this technology, we examined the ability of NLP to correctly identify common elements described by surgeons in operative notes for total hip arthroplasty (THA).\\n\\nMethods: \\nWe evaluated primary THAs that had been performed at a single academic institution from 2000 to 2015. A training sample of operative reports was randomly selected to develop prototype NLP algorithms, and additional operative reports were randomly selected as the test sample. Three separate algorithms were created with rules aimed at capturing (1) the operative approach, (2) the fixation method, and (3) the bearing surface category. The algorithms were applied to operative notes to evaluate the language used by 29 different surgeons at our center and were applied to EHR data from outside facilities to determine external validity. Accuracy statistics were calculated with use of manual chart review as the gold standard.\\n\\nResults: \\nThe operative approach algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.1% to 99.9%). The fixation technique algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 90.7% (95% CI, 86.8% to 93.8%). The bearing surface algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.7% to 97.8%). Additionally, the NLP algorithms applied to operative reports from other institutions yielded comparable performance, demonstrating external validity.\\n\\nConclusions: \\nNLP-enabled algorithms are a promising alternative to the current gold standard of manual chart review for identifying common data elements from orthopaedic operative notes. The present study provides a proof of concept for use of NLP techniques in clinical research studies and registry-development endeavors to reliably extract data of interest in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.'),\n",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an online image messaging platform for remote monitoring of surgical incision sites.\\n\\nMethods\\nWe conducted a retrospective review of 1434 hip and knee arthroplasty patients who registered for an online platform in the perioperative period. We reviewed images sent by patients to evaluate potential wound abnormalities. Medical records were reviewed to determine whether assessments based on wound photographs corresponded with subsequent in-person findings and ultimate disposition.\\n\\nResults\\nFour hundred thirty patients (42%) sent at least one text or image message to their provider. Elimination of redundant images resulted in 104 image encounters, with 76 discrete encounters in 41 patients related to the surgical wound. Most showed normal wound appearance; patients were reassured and urgent visits were avoided. At scheduled in-person follow-up, none of these patients demonstrated unrecognized wound complications. Seventeen image encounters in 7 patients showed possible wound abnormalities. These prompted in-person follow-up on average less than 1 day later for 4 issues deemed urgent (2 patients received surgical treatment) and 5 days later for issues deemed nonurgent.

    "This study extends a previous study that conducted perceptual training in medically-naïve individuals for the detection of NoF fractures on a variety of dataset sizes. The same anteroposterior hip radiograph dataset was used to train two DCNNs (AlexNet and GoogLeNet) to detect NoF fractures. For direct comparison with perceptual training results, deep learning was completed across a variety of dataset sizes (200, 320 and 640 images) with images split into training (80%) and validation (20%). An additional 160 images were used as the final test set. Multiple pre-processing and augmentation techniques were utilised.\n",

    "AlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs NoF fracture detection accuracy increased with larger training dataset sizes and mildly with augmentation. Accuracy increased from 81.9% and 88.1% to 89.4% and 94.4% for AlexNet and GoogLeNet respectively.

    "    ('''Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations''','''PURPOSE Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non–face-to-face care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday) and outside clinic hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from “event logging” records over a 3-year period for both direct patient care and non–face-to-face activities, and were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESULTS Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%).\n",

    "CONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information regarding clinician time allocation.'''),\n",

This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.\"),\n",

A computer system is built that takes as input the body kinetics and produces as output not only an estimation of presence of the knee osteoarthritis, as previously done in the literature, but also the most discriminating parameters along with a set of rules on how this decision was reached. This fills the gap of interpretability between the medical and the engineering approaches. We collected locomotion data from 47 subjects with knee osteoarthritis and 47 healthy subjects. Osteoarthritis subjects were recruited from hospital clinics and GP surgeries, and age and sex matched healthy subjects from the local community. Subjects walked on a walkway equipped with two force plates with piezoelectric 3-component force sensors. Parameters of the vertical, anterior–posterior, and medio-lateral ground reaction forces, such as mean value, push-off time, and slope, were extracted. Then random forest regressors map those parameters via rule induction to the degree of knee osteoarthritis. To boost generalisation ability, a subject-independent protocol is employed. The 5-fold cross-validated accuracy is 72.61% ± 4.24%.

    "    (\"Deep neural network improves fracture detection by clinicians\",\"Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning model.

    "Methods: \n",
    "An institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment.\n",

    "Results: \n",
    "Most patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not.\n",

The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4% of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1% (range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries.

    "Participants 23 symptom checkers that were in English and provided advice across a range of conditions. 45 standardized patient vignettes were compiled and equally divided into three categories of triage urgency: emergent care required (for example, pulmonary embolism), non-emergent care reasonable (for example, otitis media), and self care reasonable (for example, viral upper respiratory tract infection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Main outcome measures For symptom checkers that provided a diagnosis, our main outcomes were whether the symptom checker listed the correct diagnosis first or within the first 20 potential diagnoses (n=770 standardized patient evaluations). For symptom checkers that provided a triage recommendation, our main outcomes were whether the symptom checker correctly recommended emergent care, non-emergent care, or self care (n=532 standardized patient evaluations).\n",

    "Results The 23 symptom checkers provided the correct diagnosis first in 34% (95% confidence interval 31% to 37%) of standardized patient evaluations, listed the correct diagnosis within the top 20 diagnoses given in 58% (55% to 62%) of standardized patient evaluations, and provided the appropriate triage advice in 57% (52% to 61%) of standardized patient evaluations. Triage performance varied by urgency of condition, with appropriate triage advice provided in 80% (95% confidence interval 75% to 86%) of emergent cases, 55% (47% to 63%) of non-emergent cases, and 33% (26% to 40%) of self care cases (P<0.001).

To use an innovative videotape analysis method to examine how clinic time was spent during elderly patients' visits to primary care physicians. Secondary objectives were to identify the factors that influence time allocations.\n",

    "Data Sources. A convenience sample of 392 videotapes of routine office visits conducted between 1998 and 2000 from multiple primary care practices in the United States, supplemented by patient and physician surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Design. Videotaped visits were examined for visit length and time devoted to specific topics—a novel approach to study time allocation. A survival analysis model analyzed the effects of patient, physician, and physician practice setting on how clinic time was spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Findings. Very limited amount of time was dedicated to specific topics in office visits. The median visit length was 15.7 minutes covering a median of six topics. About 5 minutes were spent on the longest topic whereas the remaining topics each received 1.1 minutes. While time spent by patient and physician on a topic responded to many factors, length of the visit overall varied little even when contents of visits varied widely. Macro factors associated with each site had more influence on visit and topic length than the nature of the problem patients presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions. Many topics compete for visit time, resulting in small amount of time being spent on each topic. A highly regimented schedule might interfere with having sufficient time for patients with complex or multiple problems. Efforts to improve the quality of care need to recognize the time pressure on both patients and physicians, the effects of financial incentives, and the time costs of improving patient–physician interactions.'''),\n",

    "Methods\n",
    "We conducted a retrospective review of 1434 hip and knee arthroplasty patients who registered for an online platform in the perioperative period.

    "Results\n",
    "Four hundred thirty patients (42%) sent at least one text or image message to their provider. Elimination of redundant images resulted in 104 image encounters, with 76 discrete encounters in 41 patients related to the surgical wound. Most showed normal wound appearance; patients were reassured and urgent visits were avoided. At scheduled in-person follow-up, none of these patients demonstrated unrecognized wound complications. Seventeen image encounters in 7 patients showed possible wound abnormalities. These prompted in-person follow-up on average less than 1 day later for 4 issues deemed urgent (2 patients received surgical treatment) and 5 days later for issues deemed nonurgent. Photos were also used to monitor abnormal wounds over time and to send information unrelated to wounds.\n",

The same anteroposterior hip radiograph dataset was used to train two DCNNs (AlexNet and GoogLeNet) to detect NoF fractures. For direct comparison with perceptual training results, deep learning was completed across a variety of dataset sizes (200, 320 and 640 images) with images split into training (80%) and validation (20%). An additional 160 images were used as the final test set. Multiple pre-processing and augmentation techniques were utilised.\\n\\nResults\\nAlexNet and GoogLeNet DCNNs NoF fracture detection accuracy increased with larger training dataset sizes and mildly with augmentation. Accuracy increased from 81.9% and 88.1% to 89.4% and 94.4% for AlexNet and GoogLeNet respectively. Similarly, the test accuracy for the perceptual training in top-performing medically-naïve individuals increased from 87.6% to 90.5% when trained on 640 images compared with 200 images.\\n\\nConclusions\\nSingle detection tasks in radiology are commonly used in DCNN research with their results often used to make broader claims about machine learning being able to perform as well as subspecialty radiologists. This study suggests that as impressive as recognising fractures is for a DCNN, similar learning can be achieved by top-performing medically-naïve humans with less than 1 hour of perceptual training.',\n",
       " 'Tethered to the EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data and Time-Motion Observations PURPOSE Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient care. Demand for non–face-to-face care, such as communication through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday) and outside clinic hours.\\n\\nMETHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from “event logging” records over a 3-year period for both direct patient care and non–face-to-face activities, and were validated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic hours.\\n\\nRESULTS Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2%). Inbox management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7%).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians spend more than one-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information regarding clinician time allocation.',\n",

We assessed the ability of a CNN, with a fast object detection algorithm previously identifying the regions of interest, to detect distal radius fractures (DRFs) on anterior–posterior (AP) wrist radiographs.\\n\\nPatients and methods — 2,340 AP wrist radiographs from 2,340 patients were enrolled in this study. We trained the CNN to analyze wrist radiographs in the dataset. Feasibility of the object detection algorithm was evaluated by intersection of the union (IOU). The diagnostic performance of the network was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index; the results were compared with those of medical professional groups.\\n\\nResults — The object detection model achieved a high average IOU, and none of the IOUs had a value less than 0.5. The AUC of the CNN for this test was 0.96. The network had better performance in distinguishing images with DRFs from normal images compared with a group of radiologists in terms of the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden Index. The network presented a similar diagnostic performance to that of the orthopedists in terms of these variables.\\n\\nInterpretation — The network exhibited a diagnostic ability similar to that of the orthopedists and a performance superior to that of the radiologists in distinguishing AP wrist radiographs with DRFs from normal images under limited conditions.

       " 'On the ethics of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.',\n",

Prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions were defined as continuous opioid prescriptions after surgery to at least 90 days after surgery. Five machine learning algorithms were developed to predict this outcome and were assessed by discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.\\n\\nResults\\nOverall, 5507 patients underwent THA, of which 345 (6.3%) had prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions. The factors determined for prediction of prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions were age, duration of opioid exposure, preoperative hemoglobin, and preoperative medications (antidepressants, benzodiazepines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-2-agonists). The elastic-net penalized logistic regression model achieved the best performance across discrimination (c-statistic = 0.77), calibration, and decision curve analysis. This model was incorporated into a digital application able to provide both predictions and explanations (available at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/thaopioid/).\\n\\nConclusion\\nIf externally validated in independent populations, the algorithms developed in this study could improve preoperative screening and support for THA patients at high risk for prolonged postoperative opioid prescriptions. Early identification and intervention in high-risk cases may mitigate the long-term adverse consequence of opioid dependence.',\n",

A computer system is built that takes as input the body kinetics and produces as output not only an estimation of presence of the knee osteoarthritis, as previously done in the literature, but also the most discriminating parameters along with a set of rules on how this decision was reached. This fills the gap of interpretability between the medical and the engineering approaches. We collected locomotion data from 47 subjects with knee osteoarthritis and 47 healthy subjects. Osteoarthritis subjects were recruited from hospital clinics and GP surgeries, and age and sex matched healthy subjects from the local community. Subjects walked on a walkway equipped with two force plates with piezoelectric 3-component force sensors. Parameters of the vertical, anterior–posterior, and medio-lateral ground reaction forces, such as mean value, push-off time, and slope, were extracted. Then random forest regressors map those parameters via rule induction to the degree of knee osteoarthritis. To boost generalisation ability, a subject-independent protocol is employed. The 5-fold cross-validated accuracy is 72.61% ± 4.24%. We show that with 3 steps or less a reliable clinical measure can be extracted in a rule-based approach when the dataset is analysed appropriately.',\n",

       " 'Deep neural network improves fracture detection by clinicians Suspected fractures are among the most common reasons for patients to visit emergency departments (EDs), and X-ray imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used by clinicians to assess patients for fractures. Missing a fracture in a radiograph often has severe consequences for patients, resulting in delayed treatment and poor recovery of function. Nevertheless, radiographs in emergency settings are often read out of necessity by emergency medicine clinicians who lack subspecialized expertise in orthopedics, and misdiagnosed fractures account for upward of four of every five reported diagnostic errors in certain EDs. In this work, we developed a deep neural network to detect and localize fractures in radiographs. We trained it to accurately emulate the expertise of 18 senior subspecialized orthopedic surgeons by having them annotate 135,409 radiographs. We then ran a controlled experiment with emergency medicine clinicians to evaluate their ability to detect fractures in wrist radiographs with and without the assistance of the deep learning model. The average clinician’s sensitivity was 80.8% (95% CI, 76.7–84.1%) unaided and 91.5% (95% CI, 89.3–92.9%) aided, and specificity was 87.5% (95 CI, 85.3–89.5%) unaided and 93.9% (95% CI, 92.9–94.9%) aided. The average clinician experienced a relative reduction in misinterpretation rate of 47.0% (95% CI, 37.4–53.9%). The significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy that we observed in this study show that deep learning methods are a mechanism by which senior medical specialists can deliver their expertise to generalists on the front lines of medicine, thereby providing substantial improvements to patient care.',\n",

Unlike static regression analyses that provide a momentary prediction, ML algorithms are dynamic in that they are readily capable of imbibing historical data to build a framework that improves with additive data.\\nPurpose:\\nTo (1) characterize the epidemiology of publicly reported NHL injuries from 2007 to 2017, (2) determine the validity of a machine learning model in predicting next-season injury risk for both goalies and position players, and (3) compare the performance of modern ML algorithms versus logistic regression (LR) analyses.\\nStudy Design:\\nDescriptive epidemiology study.\\nMethods:\\nProfessional NHL player data were compiled for the years 2007 to 2017 from 2 publicly reported databases in the absence of an official NHL-approved database. Attributes acquired from each NHL player from each professional year included age, 85 performance metrics, and injury history. A total of 5 ML algorithms were created for both position player and goalie data: random forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Top 3 Ensemble. LR was also performed for both position player and goalie data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) primarily determined validation.\\nResults:\\nPlayer data were generated from 2109 position players and 213 goalies. For models predicting next-season injury risk for position players, XGBoost performed the best with an AUC of 0.948, compared with an AUC of 0.937 for LR (P < .0001). For models predicting next-season injury risk for goalies, XGBoost had the highest AUC with 0.956, compared with an AUC of 0.947 for LR (P < .0001).\\nConclusion:\\nAdvanced ML models such as XGBoost outperformed LR and demonstrated good to excellent capability of predicting whether a publicly reportable injury is likely to occur the next season.',\n",

Correction factors were developed to adjust data from before the standard pregnancy question was adopted to promote accurate trend analysis. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends for groups of states with similar pregnancy questions.\\n\\nRESULTS: \\nThe estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births) for 48 states and Washington, DC (excluding California and Texas, analyzed separately) increased by 26.6%, from 18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014. California showed a declining trend, whereas Texas had a sudden increase in 2011–2012. Analysis of the measurement change suggests that U.S. rates in the early 2000s were higher than previously reported.\\n\\nCONCLUSION: \\nDespite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal for a 75% reduction in maternal mortality by 2015, the estimated maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington, DC, increased from 2000 to 2014; the international trend was in the opposite direction.

       " 'Negative Patient-Experience Comments After Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Background: \\nThere is growing interest in enhancing the patient experience after discretionary orthopaedic surgery. Patient narratives are a potentially valuable but largely unscrutinized source of information. Using machine learning to understand sentiment within patient-experience comments, we explored the content of negative comments after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), their associated factors, and their relationship with traditional measures of patient satisfaction and with perioperative outcomes.\\n\\nMethods: \\nAn institutional registry was used to link the records of 186 patients who had undergone elective primary TSA between 2016 and 2017 with vendor-supplied patient satisfaction data, which included patient comments and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Using a machine-learning-based natural language processing approach, all patient comments were mined for sentiment and classified as positive, negative, mixed, or neutral. Negative comments were further classified into themes. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine characteristics associated with providing a negative comment.\\n\\nResults: \\nMost patients (71%) provided at least 1 comment; 32% of the comments were negative, 62% were positive, 5% were mixed, and 1% were neutral. The themes of the negative comments were room condition (27%), time management (17%), inefficient communication (13%), lack of compassion (12%), difficult intravenous (IV) insertion (10%), food (10%), medication side effects (6%), discharge instructions (4%), and pain management (2%). Women and sicker patients were more likely to provide negative comments. Patients who made negative comments were more likely to be dissatisfied with overall hospital care and with pain management (2 HCAHPS core items), but there were no differences in any of the studied outcomes (peak pain intensity, opioid intake, operative time, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or 1-year American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) between those who provided negative comments and those who did not.\\n\\nConclusions: \\nPatient-narrative analysis can shed light on the aspects of the process of care that are most critiqued by patients. While patient satisfaction may not be a surrogate for effectiveness of care or functional outcomes, efforts to improve the hospital environment, enhance nontechnical skills, and reduce unnecessary delays are important in providing high-quality, patient-centered care after TSA.',\n",

The MCID cutoffs for the Hip Outcome Score–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), HOS–Sport Specific (HOS-SS), and modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) were 9.8, 14.4, and 9.14, respectively. Predictive models for achieving the MCID with respect to each were built with the LASSO algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for feature selection, followed by logistic regression on the selected features. Study data were analyzed with PatientIQ, a cloud-based research and analytics platform for health care.\\nResults:\\nOf 1103 patients who met inclusion criteria, 898 (81.4%) had a minimum of 2-year reported outcomes and were entered into the modeling algorithm. A total of 74.0%, 73.5%, and 79.9% met the HOS-ADL, HOS-SS, and mHHS threshold scores for achieving the MCID. Predictors of not achieving the HOS-ADL MCID included anxiety/depression, symptom duration for >2 years before surgery, higher body mass index, high preoperative HOS-ADL score, and preoperative hip injection (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the HOS-SS MCID included anxiety/depression, preoperative symptom duration for >2 years, high preoperative HOS-SS score, and preoperative hip injection, while running at least at the recreational level was a predictor of achieving HOS-SS MCID (all P < .05). Predictors of not achieving the mHHS MCID included history of anxiety or depression, high preoperative mHHS score, and hip injections, while being female was predictive of achieving the MCID (all P < .05).\\nConclusion:\\nThis study identified predictive variables for achieving clinically meaningful outcome after hip arthroscopy for FAIS. Patient factors including anxiety/depression, symptom duration >2 years, preoperative intra-articular injection, and high preoperative outcome scores are most consistently predictive of inability to achieve clinically meaningful outcome. These findings have important implications for shared decision-making algorithms and management of preoperative expectations after hip arthroscopy for FAI.',\n",

When data were not available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used.\\n\\nFindings  In 2016, the US spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on health care, and spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6% (Australia) to 12.4% (Switzerland). The proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in the US, lower than the other countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second lowest of the countries (11.4% of the US population ≥15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11 countries, 16.6%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or obese at 70.1% (range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%). Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per 1000; 43% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100\\u202f000 were 192 for acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; procedures per 100\\u202f000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement, and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8% in the US vs a range of 1% to 3% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending per capita was $1443 in the US vs a range of $466 to $939 in other countries. Salaries of physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were $218\\u202f173 in the US compared with a range of $86\\u202f607 to $154\\u202f126 in the other countries.\\n\\nConclusions and Relevance  The United States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are needed to inform policy decisions.',\n",

The primary objective of this study was to validate the feasibility of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) system in terms of the frequency of data interruptions and patient acceptance. Second, we report pilot data for (1) mobility; (2) knee range of motion, (3) patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs); (4) opioid use; and (5) home exercise program (HEP) compliance.\\n\\nMethods\\nA pilot cohort of 25 patients undergoing primary TKA for osteoarthritis was enrolled. Patients downloaded the RPM mobile application preoperatively to collect baseline activity and PROMs data, and the wearable knee sleeve was paired to the smartphone during admission. The following was collected up to 3 months postoperatively: mobility (step count), range of motion, PROMs, opioid consumption, and HEP compliance. Validation was determined by acquisition of continuous data and patient tolerance at semistructured interviews 3 months after operation.\\n\\nResults\\nOf the 25 enrolled patients, 100% had uninterrupted passive data collection. Of the 22 available for follow-up interviews, all found the system motivating and engaging. Mean mobility returned to baseline within 6 weeks and exceeded preoperative baseline by 30% at 3 months. Mean knee flexion achieved was 119°, which did not differ from clinic measurements (P = .31). Mean KOOS improvement was 39.3 after 3 months (range: 3-60). Opioid use typically stopped by postoperative day 5. HEP compliance was 62% (range: 0%-99%).\\n\\nConclusions\\nIn this pilot study, we established the ability to remotely acquire continuous data for patients undergoing TKA, who found the application to be engaging. RPM offers the newfound ability to more completely evaluate the patients undergoing TKA in terms of mobility and rehabilitation compliance.

Patients underwent preoperative computed tomography of the hip, from which the following radiographic indices were calculated by a musculoskeletal radiologist: alpha angle, beta angle, sagittal center-edge angle, coronal center-edge angle, neck shaft angle, acetabular version angle, and femoral version angle. PROM scores were collected preoperatively, at 1 year postoperatively, and at 2 years postoperatively for the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the Hip Outcome Score (HOS)–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL) and –Sport Specific (HOS-SS), and the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33). Random forest models were created for each PROM at 1 and 2 years’ follow-up, with each PROM’s MCID used to establish clinical meaningfulness. Data inputted into the models included ethnicity, laterality, sex, age, body mass index, and radiographic indices. Comprehensive and separate models were built specifically to assess the association of the alpha angle, femoral version angle, coronal center-edge angle, McKibbin index, and hip impingement index with respect to each PROM.\\nResults:\\nAs evidenced by poor area under the curves and P values >.05 for each model created, no combination of radiographic indices or isolated index (alpha angle, coronal center-edge angle, femoral version angle, McKibbin index, hip impingement index) was a significant predictor of a clinically meaningful improvement in scores on the mHHS, HOS-ADL, HOS-SS, or iHOT-33. The mean difference between 1- and 2-year PROM scores compared with preoperative values exceeded the respective MCIDs for the cohort.\\nConclusion:\\nIn patients appropriately indicated for FAIS corrective surgery, clinical improvements can be achieved, regardless of preoperative radiographic indices, such as the femoral version angle, coronal center-edge angle, and alpha angle. No specific radiographic parameter or combination of indices was found to be predictive of reaching the MCID for any of the 4 studied hip-specific PROMs at either 1 or 2 years’ follow-up.',\n",

This has the potential to allow for a risk-based PSPM prior to elective THA that offers tiered reimbursement commensurate with case complexity.',\n",
       " 'Evaluation of symptom checkers for self diagnosis and triage: audit study Objective To determine the diagnostic and triage accuracy of online symptom checkers (tools that use computer algorithms to help patients with self diagnosis or self triage).\\n\\nDesign Audit study.\\n\\nSetting Publicly available, free symptom checkers.\\n\\nParticipants 23 symptom checkers that were in English and provided advice across a range of conditions. 45 standardized patient vignettes were compiled and equally divided into three categories of triage urgency: emergent care required (for example, pulmonary embolism), non-emergent care reasonable (for example, otitis media), and self care reasonable (for example, viral upper respiratory tract infection).\\n\\nMain outcome measures For symptom checkers that provided a diagnosis, our main outcomes were whether the symptom checker listed the correct diagnosis first or within the first 20 potential diagnoses (n=770 standardized patient evaluations). For symptom checkers that provided a triage recommendation, our main outcomes were whether the symptom checker correctly recommended emergent care, non-emergent care, or self care (n=532 standardized patient evaluations).\\n\\nResults The 23 symptom checkers provided the correct diagnosis first in 34% (95% confidence interval 31% to 37%) of standardized patient evaluations, listed the correct diagnosis within the top 20 diagnoses given in 58% (55% to 62%) of standardized patient evaluations, and provided the appropriate triage advice in 57% (52% to 61%) of standardized patient evaluations. Triage performance varied by urgency of condition, with appropriate triage advice provided in 80% (95% confidence interval 75% to 86%) of emergent cases, 55% (47% to 63%) of non-emergent cases, and 33% (26% to 40%) of self care cases (P<0.001). Performance on appropriate triage advice across the 23 individual symptom checkers ranged from 33% (95% confidence interval 19% to 48%) to 78% (64% to 91%) of standardized patient evaluations.\\n\\nConclusions Symptom checkers had deficits in both triage and diagnosis. Triage advice from symptom checkers is generally risk averse, encouraging users to seek care for conditions where self care is reasonable.',\n",
       " 'Early modes of transport in the United States: Lessons for modern energy policymakers The belief that modern alternative vehicles and modes of transport continue to fail primarily for technical reasons glosses over the importance of the economic, political, social and cultural dimensions of gasoline powered automobiles. This article investigates the changes that caused manufacturers and customers to abandon bicycles, horses, electric vehicles, cable cars, trolleys, and trains and to overwhelmingly prefer gasoline-powered vehicles from 1890 to 1940 in the United States. It then focuses on the lessons that the historical transition to gasoline vehicles offers modern policymakers.',\n",
       " \"Time Allocation in Primary Care Office Visits Objectives. To use an innovative videotape analysis method to examine how clinic time was spent during elderly patients' visits to primary care physicians. Secondary objectives were to identify the factors that influence time allocations.\\n\\nData Sources. A convenience sample of 392 videotapes of routine office visits conducted between 1998 and 2000 from multiple primary care practices in the United States, supplemented by patient and physician surveys.\\n\\nResearch Design. Videotaped visits were examined for visit length and time devoted to specific topics—a novel approach to study time allocation. A survival analysis model analyzed the effects of patient, physician, and physician practice setting on how clinic time was spent.\\n\\nPrincipal Findings. Very limited amount of time was dedicated to specific topics in office visits. The median visit length was 15.7 minutes covering a median of six topics. About 5 minutes were spent on the longest topic whereas the remaining topics each received 1.1 minutes. While time spent by patient and physician on a topic responded to many factors, length of the visit overall varied little even when contents of visits varied widely. Macro factors associated with each site had more influence on visit and topic length than the nature of the problem patients presented.\\n\\nConclusions. Many topics compete for visit time, resulting in small amount of time being spent on each topic. A highly regimented schedule might interfere with having sufficient time for patients with complex or multiple problems. Efforts to improve the quality of care need to recognize the time pressure on both patients and physicians, the effects of financial incentives, and the time costs of improving patient–physician interactions.\",\n",
       " 'High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence The use of artificial intelligence, and the deep-learning subtype in particular, has been enabled by the use of labeled big data, along with markedly enhanced computing power and cloud storage, across all sectors. In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient–doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.',\n",
       " 'Use of Natural Language Processing Algorithms to Identify Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Total Hip Arthroplasty Background: \\nManual chart review is labor-intensive and requires specialized knowledge possessed by highly trained medical professionals. Natural language processing (NLP) tools are distinctive in their ability to extract critical information from raw text in electronic health records (EHRs). As a proof of concept for the potential application of this technology, we examined the ability of NLP to correctly identify common elements described by surgeons in operative notes for total hip arthroplasty (THA).\\n\\nMethods: \\nWe evaluated primary THAs that had been performed at a single academic institution from 2000 to 2015. A training sample of operative reports was randomly selected to develop prototype NLP algorithms, and additional operative reports were randomly selected as the test sample. Three separate algorithms were created with rules aimed at capturing (1) the operative approach, (2) the fixation method, and (3) the bearing surface category. The algorithms were applied to operative notes to evaluate the language used by 29 different surgeons at our center and were applied to EHR data from outside facilities to determine external validity. Accuracy statistics were calculated with use of manual chart review as the gold standard.\\n\\nResults: \\nThe operative approach algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.1% to 99.9%). The fixation technique algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 90.7% (95% CI, 86.8% to 93.8%). The bearing surface algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.7% to 97.8%). Additionally, the NLP algorithms applied to operative reports from other institutions yielded comparable performance, demonstrating external validity.\\n\\nConclusions: \\nNLP-enabled algorithms are a promising alternative to the current gold standard of manual chart review for identifying common data elements from orthopaedic operative notes. The present study provides a proof of concept for use of NLP techniques in clinical research studies and registry-development endeavors to reliably extract data of interest in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.',\n",
       " 'Monitoring Surgical Incision Sites in Orthopedic Patients Using an Online Physician-Patient Messaging Platform Background\\nPrompt identification and treatment of wound complications is essential after joint arthroplasty, but emergency department and office visits for urgent evaluation of normal incisions are a source of unnecessary cost. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an online image messaging platform for remote monitoring of surgical incision sites.\\n\\nMethods\\nWe conducted a retrospective review of 1434 hip and knee arthroplasty patients who registered for an online platform in the perioperative period. We reviewed images sent by patients to evaluate potential wound abnormalities. Medical records were reviewed to determine whether assessments based on wound photographs corresponded with subsequent in-person findings and ultimate disposition.\\n\\nResults\\nFour hundred thirty patients (42%) sent at least one text or image message to their provider. Elimination of redundant images resulted in 104 image encounters, with 76 discrete encounters in 41 patients related to the surgical wound. Most showed normal wound appearance; patients were reassured and urgent visits were avoided. At scheduled in-person follow-up, none of these patients demonstrated unrecognized wound complications. Seventeen image encounters in 7 patients showed possible wound abnormalities. These prompted in-person follow-up on average less than 1 day later for 4 issues deemed urgent (2 patients received surgical treatment) and 5 days later for issues deemed nonurgent. Photos were also used to monitor abnormal wounds over time and to send information unrelated to wounds.\\n\\nConclusion\\nUtilization of an online physician-patient messaging platform can prevent unnecessary visits for normal appearing wounds, while facilitating rapid in-person treatment of wound complications.']"
